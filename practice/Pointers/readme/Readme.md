* In programming, variables store data (like numbers or text), but pointers store the memory address where that data is kept.
* Instead of directly holding the value, a pointer "points" to where the value is stored.

So, instead of directly using the value, you can use the pointer to find and work with the value stored at that memory address. This helps you to manage memory more efficiently, especially in large programs.
